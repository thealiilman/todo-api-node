# todo-api-node
A Node.js to-do back-end. It consist of CRUD APIs.

## Motivation
I'm feeling comfortable with Rails, and having worked with Rails for over 3 years, it's time to expand one's horizons. ðŸ¤“
I chose Node.js because I'm already familiar with JavaScript.

What I aim to learn from this project are...

- Building Node.js APIs
- Configuring Node.js back-ends
- Testing Node.js APIs
- And perhaps, deploying a Node.js back-end

## Setup
Coming soon!
